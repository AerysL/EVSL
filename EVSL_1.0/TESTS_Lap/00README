These  drivers  are for  testing  a  few methods  on  simple
Laplacean matrices.   For better  clarity we  have separated
the  makefiles  in  two:  makefileP  (to  make  the  drivers
invoking Polynomial  filtering) and  makefileR (to  make the
drivers invoking Rational filtering).

LapPLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make -f makefileP LapPLanR.ex--> executable LapPLanR.ex

LapPLanN.c :   
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter non-restarting Lanczos 
    make -f makefileP LapPLanN.ex--> executable LapPLanN.ex

LapPSI.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Subspace Iteration
    make -f makefileP LapPSI.ex--> executable LapPSI.ex

LapRLanR.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make -f makefileR LapRLanR.ex--> executable LapRLanR.ex

LapRLanN.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter non-restart Lanczos 
    make -f makefileR LapRLanN.ex--> executable LapRLanN.ex

To compute all the eigenvalues of a Laplacian discretized on
an N1*N2*N3  grid, located in  the interval [D1, D2]  with K
slices:

./Lap*.ex -nx N1 -ny N2 -nz N3 -a D1 -b D2 -nslices K
