Gen_Lap

  Test drivers  are for  testing  a  few methods  on  simple
  (artificial) Laplacean matrix pair (A, B).  

Gen_MM
 
 Drivers  for testing  a  few routines  for  computing eigenvalues  of
 general sparse (symmetric real) matrix pair (A, B), where B has to be
 positive definite.  These matrices are read from a file in the matrix
 market format.  Note: The HB matrix format is not supported.

Landos
 
 Drivers for testing Density of states routines. So far the Lanczos 
 method for DOS is tested.
