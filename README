         Polynomial  and   Rational  Filtered  Lanczos   and  subspace
         iteration algorithms For Symmetric Eigenvalue problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to EVSL. EVSL is a C library for computing the eigenvalues of
a symmetric matrix  that are located in a given  interval.  This first
release includes the routines listed above and does not yet offer full
parallel implementations  (trivial openMP test programs  are available
in among  the test  drivers).  EVSL also  provides tools  for spectrum
slicing, i.e.,  the technique of  subdividing a given interval  into p
smaller subintervals and computing the eigenvalues in each subinterval
independently.  EVSL  implements a polynomial filtered  Lanczos (thick
restart, no  restart) a rational  filtered Lanczos (thick  restart, no
restart), and a polynomial filtered subspace iteration.
